The purpose of this summer course is to get your math skills up to the level that is required to arrive well prepared at the start of the upcoming academic year and fill any gaps in your understanding of the secondary school math curriculum. 

In order to do so, the most fundamental concepts from calculus and algebra will be introduced and discussed. Rather than overwhelming the reader with mathematical formalism and theorems, this course focuses on the more practical side of the covered subjects. The skills acquired in this way are a prerequisite for furthering the reader's understanding of calculus and algebra through the respective courses in first year of the programme. After providing a sound underpinning of the secondary school math curriculum, those courses will introduce the reader to more advanced topics such as vector functions, functions of several variables and optimisation, which are crucial to solve current and future engineering problems. 

Even though much time and efforts have been spent in compiling this text, it cannot be free of errors, and the authors would be grateful if these would be reported to them so that the quality of this text can be improved even further.
